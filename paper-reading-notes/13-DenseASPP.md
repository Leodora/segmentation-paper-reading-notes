## Note



### Key Words



## Five questions about this paper:

### 1. [Problem Definition / Motivation] What problem is this paper trying to solve? 
+ Atrous convolution is proposed to enlarge the size of reception field and dicrease the cost of computing simultaneously.
+ ASPP is proposed to concatenate feature maps generated by atrous convolution with different dilation rates.

But when high resolution images are used as the input of segmentation methods, the size of reception field never becomes big enough. And large enough dilation ratio will decrease the power of model. 

Therefore, it is important to design a network structure that is able to encode multi-scale information, and simultaneously achieves a large enough receptive field size.

PS: deeper network will have bigger receptive field, actually I'dont think it's a big problem.
