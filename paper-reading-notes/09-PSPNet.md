## Note
The network structure is pretty simple, just concat features of different scales.
The way of cancatenation is different from Spatial Pyramid Pooling(SPP). SPP concats different scale features into a vector, but PSPNet clues them together, making the output feature thicker.

SPP:

## Five questions about this paper:

### 1. [Problem Definition / Motivation] What problem is this paper trying to solve? 
The current FCN based models are lacking of suitable strategy to utilize global scene category clues.


### 2. [Contribution / Method] What's new in this paper? / How does this paper solve the above problems?
Concatenating features of different scales to capture more global information.


### 3. Details about the experiment

Average pooling is better than max pooling.

Multi-scale pooling is helpful to capture more details.

### 4. Advantages (self-summary rather than the author's)
1. The network structure is quite simple but powerful.


### 5. Disadvantages (self-summary rather than the author's)
1. Concatenating is helpful, but easier to bring more noise and redundancy.
