## Note
The DUpsampling method:

+ data dependent
+ no need to constrain the resolution of features to be very high (like 1/4 or 1/8 ) that need to be upsampled

### 1. Beyond Bilinear: Datadependent Upsampling

W is learned from the process of downsampling and recontruction of the GT label map.

$x = Pv; v_{hat} =Wx; $

For GT label map (high resolution) Y, v is the sub-region of it and x if a vector in lower-dimension.

$v_{hat}$ is the reconstructed GT label map.

And this learned W can be used to upsample the fused feature map.

### 2. Incorporating DUpsampling with Adaptivetemperature Softmax
Vanilla softmax function (looks like just normal softmax) is hard to converge when incorporating DUpsampling, and also has difficulty in producing sharp enough activation.

A parameter named temperature T is used here to sharpen/soften the activation of softmax and makes training converge much faster.

### Key Words



## Five questions about this paper:

### 1. [Problem Definition / Motivation] What problem is this paper trying to solve? 
+ The overall strides of the encode must be reduced to get features in receptable resolution, for example from $1/{32}$ to $1/4$. Because bilinear upsampling method is data independent, and doesn't take account of the correlations of pixels.


### 2. [Contribution / Method] What's new in this paper? / How does this paper solve the above problems?
+ Use a data dependent method DUpsampling to replace the data independent method bilinear upsampling.
